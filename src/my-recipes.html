     <ul>3 teaspoons packed brown sugar</ul>
     <ul>1 teaspoon cumin</ul>
     <ul>1 teaspoon garlic powder</ul>

     <ol>Cut ribs into 4 sections (if desired - you could leave them whole). Rub spice mixture over both sides of the ribs.</ol>
     <ol>Lightly grease a 4 quart slow cooker and line the sections of ribs up around the edges (so the meaty part is pressed against the side). Cover and cook on low for 8 hours.</ol>
     <ol>Remove from the slow cooker, brush with barbecue sauce, and grill for 5-6 minutes or broil for 2-3 minutes, until sauce is sticky and slightly caramelized. Serve.</ol>

     <h2>Slow Cooker Pork Tenderloin with Honey Balsamic Glaze</h2>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     
     <ul>1 pork tenderloin about 1 lb</ul>
     <ul>1 teaspoon garlic powder</ul>
     <ul>1 teaspoon dried parsley</ul>

     <ul>2 teaspoons corn starch</ul>

     <h3>Instructions</h3>

     <ol>In a small bowl, combine garlic, parsley, salt, pepper, onion powder and paprika. Rub over all sides of the pork tenderloin and place in the slow cooker (I use a 2.5 quart oval slow cooker).</ol>
